/**
 * Full-stack smoke test — kubestellar/console#6362
 *
 * Runs against the actual Go backend binary (not the Vite dev server), so
 * regressions that cross the Go<->frontend boundary (API shape drift, new
 * handlers missing from routing, build-tag issues) show up in CI.
 *
 * The existing Playwright suite in this directory hits 'npm run dev' — a
 * frontend-only smoke — so a Go-side regression wouldn't surface until
 * runtime. This test closes that specific blind spot.
 *
 * Caveats (deferred follow-up in #6362):
 *   - does not exercise kc-agent (no kubeconfig in CI)
 *   - does not exercise OAuth (GitHub OAuth flow requires real creds)
 *   - does not exercise WebSocket streams
 *
 * Driven from .github/workflows/fullstack-e2e.yml, which spins up the Go
 * binary with minimal env and points PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL at port 8080.
 *
 * Local runner: scripts/run-fullstack-e2e.sh (or `npm run test:e2e:fullstack`)
 * builds Go + frontend, starts the backend, and runs this spec automatically.
